# QR Code Scanner App

## Overview
The QR Code Scanner App is a simple yet powerful iOS application that allows users to quickly and efficiently scan QR codes using their device's camera. The app provides a seamless and intuitive experience for decoding QR codes and presenting their content in an organized manner.

## Features
- **Real-time Scanning:** The app utilizes the device's camera to scan QR codes in real-time, ensuring a smooth and responsive scanning experience.

- **QR Code Content Display:** Once a QR code is scanned, the app displays the decoded content on a separate view controller, providing users with a clear and readable representation of the information contained within the QR code.

- **Bounding Box Visualization:** The scanned QR code is visually highlighted with a bounding box, enhancing the user's understanding of the detected code's position within the captured image.

- **Error Handling:** The app employs robust error handling to gracefully handle scenarios such as no camera availability, unsupported input, and output types, ensuring a reliable user experience.

- **MVVM Architecture:** The project follows the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture, promoting code organization and separation of concerns. The architecture enhances maintainability, testability, and extensibility of the application.

- Swift programming language
- UIKit framework for building the user interface
